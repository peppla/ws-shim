/*
 * shim.c - A dynamic library shim to capture TLS keys for Wireshark
 *
 * This library intercepts SSL_CTX_new and SSL_CTX_new_ex calls to install a
 * keylog callback that writes TLS session keys to a file specified by the
 * SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable. This allows tools like Wireshark to
 * decrypt TLS traffic for analysis.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Compile this file into a shared library:
 *        gcc -shared -fPIC -o shim.so shim.c -ldl -lpthread -lssl
 *   2. Set the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable to the desired log file path:
 *        export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/your/keylogfile.log
 *   3. Preload the shim library when running your application:
 *        LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/shim.so your_application
 *
 * Note: This code is intended for debugging and analysis purposes only.
 *       It should not be used in production environments due to potential
 *       security and performance implications.
